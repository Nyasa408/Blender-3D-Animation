# Blender Animated Scenes ðŸŽ¥

This repository contains two Blender-animated scenes created as part of my 3D animation practice:  
- **Camera Animation** â†’ A smooth cinematic fly-through sequence  
- **Character Animation** â†’ A simple animated character performance  

Both projects were created and rendered using **Blender [version you used]**.
